    <h1>Comparative Research</h1>

  <section>
    <p>For my final project, I would like to create an easy-to-use interactive schedule system that is targeted to young adults in college or beyond, while bolstering their creativity and encouraging them to plan things daily. Two comparable apps
      that are well known and commonly used are Instagram and Mint. Instagram is a social media website that stores photos, often personal to the individual, while Mint is an app that helps the user budget their spending. While they are functionally
      very different, the idea of personal storage is something they both have, and it is what I would like to try incorporating into the project.

      <img src="../../images/screenshots.jpg" alt="instagram.com and mint.com screen capture">
      <br>Instagram’s interface acts like a personal board with the user information on the side, but larger emphasis on the pictures posted. There is a scroll function that allows the viewer to scroll down easily without interruption and
      redirection to another page. On the other hand, Mint’s formatting is similar, but instead of nice images on a board it displays bills that still need to be fulfilled by the user. The biggest contrast between the two apps is that Instagram is
      designed for social media uses in mind, while Mint is a private form of information storage. As a result, Instagram is streamlined for quick browsing with visuals as its primary feature of what the app is designed around, but the informational
      design of Mint makes it slower to process. However, this allows the user to focus more on what is being presented over a quick glance on Instagram, making this design better for retaining important information. Mint also provides customization
      to some of the interface, so that the user can tailor the app to their personal preference. On the other hand, the images on Instagram are more fun to look at, and the prospect of viewing new images from favorite artists or people has
      entertainment value, in addition to the social interaction. Both apps tend to favor plain white background on their interfaces so that the important information can be found unimpeded by anything extraneous. </p>
