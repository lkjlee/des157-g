    <h1>Final Project: Background Research</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>For this project, I am interested in finding research that can support my idea for a mobile website that helps students schedule their time in a fun and creative way. I picked out three articles: the first article is about time management for
      students, the second is on happiness with social media, and the final article is about how much digital media through technology is effective in schools. In respective order, these three articles provided information on known time management
      skills for students, the effectiveness of social media on the user, and being careful to make the user not too dependent on the technology.</p>

    <p>In Phillips’ article, he briefly opens with how a high GPA can affect how a future employer perceives the student, claiming it can reflect how well a student manages their time during study. His target audience is engineering students. In a
      list, he tells the reader not to procrastinate, create study time, understand what time is best for the reader to work, take breaks, to not even think about distractions, sleep, and finally, making sure the reader has time to have fun on
      weekends to relax. He also provides a small formula about how many hours a student needs to spend for an example class to put it in perspective. On the next page, he recorded several actual engineering students about their time management
      skills for further advice.</p>

    <p>Miller’s article goes into depth on the state of happiness for people around the world of varying cultures. It talks about how happiness is not clear-cut for all people and multiple factors can influence how one becomes happy, such as
      different cultural values or a state of a government. The second topic it covers is the feeling of fulfillment social media helps provide for people, so it suggests that this is an aspect of universal happiness as well as a new way to feel
      dissatisfaction depending on the context. The third section talks about social media being a reinforcement of ideals that feels like they are dissipating for individuals in their current tangible surrounding environment. The article continues
      with an analysis on temporary pleasures of social media, possible added stress, and how it can make people look happier, inside its research.</p>

    <p>Daniels’ article discusses digital media and technology being used as a convention for schools is brought under critical scrutiny. According to the article, more often schools appear to be focused that technology is a “fix-all” for
      educational problems and conventions. It analyzes the sociology developing rapidly around that idea of constantly upgrading educational material into technology, such as teaching games. It also mentions possible commercialization of
      digital-based enterprises, such as Google, that use the technology to control what is outputted to the user and makes privacy a big question. In their conclusion, they are optimistic about the future for digital media, but also wish to
      advocate the idea of being critical of both the positive and negative aspects converting educational materials into digital technology.</p>
